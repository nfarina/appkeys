# Appkeys

Appkeys is a macOS menubar app that allows you to easily assign global hotkeys to your most-used apps. That's it!

Appkeys is a vibe-coded simplified remake of one of my favorite apps, [Apptivate](http://www.apptivateapp.com). I used Apptivate all day every day for many years, long after it stopped receiving updates. Eventually it would crash every time I changed my hotkeys, so I gave up and made my own version. And here it is!

It does one thing and does it well.
